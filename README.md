Files:
	IOJones.app

Requirements:
	Mac OSX Mountain Lion (10.8)+

Purpose:
	An open source replacement for IORegistryExplorer
	
Notice:
	Only Mountain Lion and newer binaries will be compiled.

Use:
	Open the app to see a representation of your IORegistry. Browse by
	outline, or browser, and select entries to see their properties.
	Also supports revealing kernel extensions in Finder, and automatic
	updates (on your machine only, before saving). Uses a simple-to-read
	file format, using property lists. Files can be queried without the
	app, simplifying reuse. Files can also be read by newer versions of
	MaciASL.
